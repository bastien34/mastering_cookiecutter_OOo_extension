Configurator Tool Extension
===========================

## Features
Allow to easily configure a new extension project. Creates Addons like menubar,
toolbar and options dialog as well.

Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

## Usage
First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome!

    $ pip3 install --user "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"

Install extension called 'ext_gen-version.oxt'. In the new menubar, click on 
"Create a New extension" button.

Configure the output path for your new extension. By default, it's your **/home/$USER/**.

Once your tables are fulfilled, simply click on the button "Generate your extension".
It will generate the extension and a **src/** directory in the directory you setup
as output.

```
├── my_extension
│   ├── extension
│   ├── src
│   └── README.md
```
You can test the created extension right out of the box. It will contain option 
dialog for the options defined in the generator, menubar and toobar.

Start working in the src/ directory. Python code should be located 
in `src/python/you_extension.py`.

### Filenames coding
You'll find a file description here: 
https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Extensions/File_Format

We use `{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}` in filename to keep things distinct and 
well organized. If you have many extensions, each one with a config.xcu, it 
might be difficult to find straight away which project it belongs to.


|File     | Note                      | Location         |
| ---       | ---                                 |---              |
|dialog.xdl     | Content of graphic Windows, build using the LibO dialog editor. (290x215 max)|dialogs/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_dialog.xdl
|manifest.xml    | Contains appropriate entry for modules, configuration data.      |META-INF/manifest.xml
|config.xcs    | Configuration schema of your vars.      |config/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_config.xcs
|dialog.xcu   | Configuration data file gives location for executables and dialog box.      |config/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_dialog.xcu
|options.component| Dialog handler location and implementation name | config/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_options.component
|dialog_handler.py| Dialog handler file | python/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_dialog_handler.py
|module.py| File where you'll start working on your code. Contains a simple launcher. | python/{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}.py
|description.xml| Description of your extension. See below. |  description.xml
|AddonUI.xcu| Toolbars and Menubar. |  AddonUI.xcu


#### Options Dialog Window
This `.xdl` file contains the description of the graphic Windows. We build it 
using the LibO dialog editor.

The size of the windows should be something like width: 290, height: 215.

It may not have the “OK”, “CANCEL”, “HELP” or “Back” buttons. These buttons are 
already part of OOo's options dialog and the options dialog created by the 
Extension Manager.


#### manifest.xml
An extension needs to provide configuration data (xcu files) in order to define 
modules, nodes and leaves. These files can be anywhere in the extension, except 
in META-INF, and there must be an appropriate entry in the manifest-xml.

#### Config file: `{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_config.xcs`
The configuration Schema file gives important information on your vars. For this
first version, I let personal stuff. It's up to you to adapt it manually to
your needs.

Important var here is `oor:package="{{cookiecutter.package_name}}`

#### Config file: `{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_dialog.xcu`
The configuration data file gives location for executables, for the dialog box. 

Contains:

- Nodes name: defined as: {{cookiecutter.package_name}}.Node1. 
(e.g.: `com.mycompany.myextension.node1`)

- Nodes label: defined as: {{cookiecutter.extension_label}} (e.g.: `My Extension`)

- Leaves name: {{cookiecutter.package_name}} After multiple experiment, it seems 
that it is here the unique identifier as said above: "Every leaf has exactly one 
Options page and is assigned to exactly one Node and one Dialog".

- Leaves id: {{cookiecutter.package_name}} (See Identifier section before)

- EventHandler Service: `{{cookiecutter.package_name}}.service`


#### Config file: `{{cookiecutter.extension_name}}_options.component`
This file gives the dialog handler location (seen before) and the implementation 
name.

- Implementation name: `{{cookiecutter.package_name}}.IM` 

- Event handler Service name: see `.xcu` config file

#### Dialog handler File: launcher of the options feature
This file uses the already configured implementation name and event handler
service name as defined above.

#### {{cookiecutter.extension_name}}.py
The file where you'll create your fantastic code. For now, we let here a
Environ class that handle all var.

#### Description: description.xml
- Company name: Your company name `{{cookiecutter.company_name}}`

- Author name: your name `{{cookiecutter.author_name}}`

- Author email: your email `{{cookiecutter.author_email}}`

- Package name: `{{cookiecutter.package_name}}` as said, **reversed_domainname
.company.product.nodename.leafname.**
which can be `com.mycompany.myextension`

- Project version: `{{cookiecutter.extension_version}}` e.g.: "0.0.1"

- Image name: `{{cookiecutter.image_name}}` Images are in `images/` folder. 
42x42. eg: `my_image.jpg` JPG or PNG can be used.

- Update URL: `{{cookiecutter.update_url}}` 

- Publisher URL: your website

- Release note url. 


#### AddonUI.xcu
File that contains everything to create toolbars and Menubar. 


## Localization

Localization (`messages.po`) are located in `python/pythonpath/locales`.
 
We used 'xgettext' to generate our template as following:

`find . -name "*.py" > potfiles`

`xgettext -n --files-from potfiles -d python/pythonpath/locales/messages `

Then you can delete the 'potfiles'.

### .po file from .xml files

Create a file `rule.its` with this content. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55270068/its-rule-to-translate-a-xml-attribute-using-namespace/55275811#55275811)
to understand why you need to declare the namespace in it.

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <its:rules xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its" version="1.0" 
               xmlns:dlg="http://openoffice.org/2000/dialog">
      <its:translateRule selector="//dlg:text/@dlg:value" translate="yes"/>
    </its:rules>

Then generate the `.po` file using `itstool`.

    $  itstool -o message_from_dialog.po -i rule.its dialogs/dialog.xdl
    
You'll have to merge them to existent message.po.


## TODO'S

### Create boilerplate from ODT File
This process could start from a python macro embedded in a `.odt` file.

This file should contain more detailed values used to create a more complete project. 
First table would contain general vars (keys / values seen above). 

The second table would contain table for Toolbar and Menubar creation as following.

**MenuBar and ToolBar**

| Function name | Function label|Module |Icon |
| ------------- |:--------------:| :-----:| --- |
| extension_launcher |My Extension   | my_extension.py |extension_icon.jpg |
| feature2_launcher      | Feature 2 | my_extension.py |feature2_icon.jpg|
| etc. | ...      | ...    |... |

And of course, a table to generate the `.xcs ` file containing options we want
for our Options dialog.

**Variables that need a Dialog Box**

| Var name | Var label | Type | Default value
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-----:| :---:
| test_mode |Test mode   | boolean | true
| token      | Token | string | find a valid token
| url      | Url | string | https://my_webservice.com/

These tables would help generate these files:

- AddonUI.xcu (Menubar & Toolbar description)

- _config.xcs (vars in Options dialog)

It should be done before the extension generation. See `hooks/pre_gen_project.py`.
It's made for that.

## Definitions from the specification document

Options dialog Specification can be found at: https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Extensions/Options_Dialog

#### Node 

In the spec, it seems that a name for a node might be: `“OpenOffice.org Writer”` 
which looks like a label. This has to be checked ! Using this node should place 
a leaf in this node.

#### Leaves

A leaf has a human readable, localized name. Every leaf has exactly one Options 
page and is assigned to exactly one Node and one Dialog. A leaf cannot have 
children. 

Leaves also have a unique identifier.

Leaves can be added to an existing Node or Nodes (unclear, we got it from specs).

#### Identifiers 

Modules, nodes, and leaves have an unique identifier. These are used as values 
for the oor:name attributes of a node element in the xcu file. Other identifiers 
are used as property values in the `.xcu` files. All these identifiers have to 
comply to the requirements for node names and value elements off the OOo registry.

To ensure uniqueness, we recommend to form the strings similar to this schema:

**reversed_domainname.company.product.nodename.leafname.**

For example:

`com.mycompany.myextension.mynode.leaf1`

For UTF8 identifier identity is element-by-element identity of the sequences of 
Unicode scalar values (no case folding, no normalization, etc.).
